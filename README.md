RETAIL PRICE OPTIMIZATION

This project focuses on optimizing the pricing strategy for retail products using data-driven techniques in Python. The goal is to identify the best price points that maximize either revenue, profit, or market share, while considering customer demand sensitivity, historical sales data, and competitive pricing.

Using machine learning and statistical modeling, the project analyzes how different price levels impact sales volumes and develops a predictive model to recommend optimal prices. Techniques such as regression analysis, price elasticity modeling, and optimization algorithms (like linear programming or grid search) are employed.

Key components include:

Data preprocessing: Cleaning and transforming historical sales and pricing data.

Exploratory data analysis (EDA): Understanding demand trends, seasonal effects, and price sensitivity.

Modeling demand: Predicting sales volume as a function of price and other variables.

Optimization: Using mathematical models to find the price point that maximizes a chosen business metric.

Visualization: Presenting findings through clear plots and dashboards.

Pandas, NumPy for data manipulation

Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly for visualization

Scikit-learn, Statsmodels for modeling
